    title: "American Psycho",
    content: `It’s without a doubt the most gruesome thing I’ve read. It’s horrifying and truly shocking at times. I had to put the book down on several occasions whilst I recovered from the graphic nature of some of it. So, a word of warning, if you don’t like blood don’t even bother picking this one up. It’s full of mutilations and brutal murder.

But the violence was so completely necessary in all its terribleness because it captures something very disturbing about the world. A question, if you will: how many people truly know you? I’m not talking about the you that everybody sees, but the real you. Not many, I’m sure. We only ever truly know ourselves because we are the only one who has access to our thoughts and hidden desires. Bateman knows this and he uses it to his advantage.

“...there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there.”

Nobody knows him. He appears to be a conformist, blending comfortably into society and all its stupid materialistic aspirations. He is very well aware of the problems society faces. His speech at the start of the book is a convincing argument, though none of his "friends" sat around the dinner table are willing to listen to him and address a real problem. They are too materialistic and self-absorbed to consider anything beyond their own lives. They simply carry on with their conversation as if he never spoke; thus, he continues on with his own destructive behaviour and slowly becomes more and more trapped, repressed and angry. I think he was, however, only ever probing them for a response to know how much he can get away with.

The book is a heavy critique on consumerism and the ridiculous nature of it. Everybody is obsessed with the latest brands and most expensive products. The homeless are always remarked on as Bateman walks past them wearing his ridiculously expensive clothing. There are endless descriptions of goods and products. The use of such a device in the narrative was a perfect way to expose how out of touch society is. It doesn’t see what’s in front of it, which allows the real Bateman to explore his darkest and most evil of fantasies unnoticed as he enacts the charade that is his life. It’s an immensely clever book and though the narrative does become dry and repetitive, it was totally necessary to show the mind of a psychopath and his fixations.

“All it comes down to is this: I feel like shit but look great.”

That being said though, I found myself struggling to read it. It wasn’t the violence or the nastiness of the protagonist that put me off, although that was truly disturbing, it was the pessimism that ran through the book. There is no hope in sight. Ellis shows us a dark part of reality, and it left me feeling rather depressed. (This isn’t a criticism of the writing, for it is a fantastic creation, it’s just a summary of my feelings, such as they are.) Afterwards, I found myself craving something light and fluffy, something that would lift my spirits and restore some of my faith in humanity.

It’s an intense book and it could leave you feeling rather shit. It affected me quite strongly, which bespeaks the power of this narrative.`,

    title: "Slaughterhouse-Five",
    content: `I have to admit to being somewhat baffled by the acclaim Slaughterhouse-5 has received over the years. Sure, the story is interesting. It has a fascinating and mostly successful blend of tragedy and comic relief. And yes, I guess the fractured structure and time-travelling element must have been quite novel and original back in the day. But that doesn't excuse the book's flaws, of which there are a great many in my (seemingly unconventional) opinion. Take, for instance, Vonnegut's endless repetition of the phrase 'So it goes.' Wikipedia informs me it crops up 106 times in the book. It felt like three hundred times to me. About forty pages into the book, I was so fed up with the words 'So it goes' that I felt like hurling the book across the room, something I have not done since trying to read up on French semiotics back in the 1990s. I got used to coming across the words every two pages or so eventually, but I never grew to like them. God, no.

I found some other nits to pick, too. Some of them were small and trivial and frankly rather ridiculous, such as -- wait for it -- the hyphen in the book's title. Seriously, what is that hyphen doing there? There's no need for a hyphen there. Couldn't someone have removed it, like, 437 editions ago? And while I'm at it, couldn't some discerning editor have done something about the monotonous quality of Vonnegut's prose -- about the interminable repetition of short subject-verb-object sentences? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all authors should use Henry James- or Claire Messud-length sentences. Heaven forbid. I'm actually rather fond of minimalism, both in visual art and in writing. But Vonnegut's prose is so sparse and simplistic it's monotonous rather than minimalist, to the point where I frequently found myself wishing for a run-on sentence every now and then, or for an actual in-depth description of something. I hardly ever got either. As a result, there were times when I felt like I was reading a bare-bones outline of a story rather than the story itself. Granted, it was an interesting outline, larded with pleasing ideas and observations, but still, I think the story could have been told in a more effective way. A less annoying way, too.

As for the plot, I liked it. I liked the little vignettes Vonnegut came up with and the colourful characters he created (the British officers being my particular favourites). I liked the fact that you're never quite sure whether Billy is suffering from dementia, brain damage or some kind of delayed post-traumatic stress disorder, or whether there is some actual time-travelling going on. I even liked the jarring switches in perspective, although I think they could have been handled in a slightly more subtle manner. And I liked the book's anti-war message, weak and defeatist though it seemed to be. In short, I liked the book, but it took some doing. I hope I'll be less annoyed by the two other Vonnegut books I have sitting on my shelves, Breakfast of Champions and Cat's Cradle.`,

    title: "The Terror",
    content: `Two British ships, the Terror and the Erebus, are frozen in the polar sea for years, waiting in vain for a summer thaw. This is, of course, based upon the doomed Franklin expedition, so we have some serious history going on here. Now, add to that a dash of the supernatural--something is out there on the ice. It terrorizes the men, seeming to materialize from nowhere. It's three times the size of a polar bear and has the vicious, bloodthirsty nature of a predator, as well as the keen intelligence of a man. It's like a giant cat toying with the two ships as if they were terrified mice in a corner. There's nowhere to go, guns don't faze the the thing the men dub "The Terror", and, now, the food supply is running out.

That's some frightening shit. It's the arctic. That alone is frightening. It can drive a man insane. It's the nothingness. The whiteness. The endless-ness. Howard Moon and Vince Noir knew not to take the tundra lightly.

And that's part of what ruined the book in the beginning. All I could think as I read the first few chapters was "ice floe, nowhere to go." I think that might have taken away from the tone a bit.

But here are some other more text-based reasons for the seething black pit of hatred that I have for this book:

a) History or supernatural, Simmons needs to pick a side because the two storylines always seemed to run parallel to one another and never quite came together. It was like, "Okay, for 100 pages, I'm going to have the men fearing for their lives as this thing attacks them. I'm going to build tension and suspense and have my readers empathetically shitting down both legs! And then I'm going to flashback for 50 pages to boring nautical talk amongst stuffy British types before the expedition and then spend 150 pages talking about Welsh Wigs and Goldner food tins and building sledges and maybe I'll even talk about buggering, but no mention whatsoever of the monster for another 50 pages!" Simmons was at his best when describing the encounters between the men and the thing on the ice, but these moments were so few and far between that I just got to the point where I didn't care anymore.

b) Too much historical minutiae. The book should have been 300 pages shorter. There were entire sections that didn't add anything to the narrative. I like my history like I like my men: short and concise.

c) Scurvy is some wicked bad shite. A slow death by scurvy is undoubtedly one of the worst ways to die. But do you know what's worse? A slow death by reading endless accounts of the symptoms of scurvy.

d) There are no likeable characters. In fact, there is little to differentiate one man from another. If you left out the dialogue tags, it would have sounded like one man having a conversation with himself. The only character I like is Pangle, who, alas, appears in just a chapter or two of this 766 page behemoth.

e) I was really pissed when I finally found out what the thing was. The main reason? THAT'S what I wanted to read more about. And it took roughly 700 pages to get to a point where I was actually interested and intrigued and it cut me off.

There were some bright spots. When Simmons wrote about the thing attacking the men, leaving bait for them and taunting them, he evoked moments that were truly terrifying and suspenseful. However, there just weren't enough of them. Sure, the attempts to survive against cold, hunger, and disease should have been compelling stuff, but they made for anemic reading when pitted against a terrifying adversary without name or shape. Also, the chapter in which the men throw a carnivale and erect tents that mirror the rooms in Edgar Allan Poe's The Masque of the Red Death is admittedly brilliant.

When it comes right down to it, though, The Mighty Boosh did a far superior job of capturing the terror of the arctic. When Howard admonishes Vince that "The arctic is no respecter of fashion," I still get chills. The same cannot be said of my reaction to The Terror.`,

    title: "The Nix",
    content: `I'm not a huge fan of long novels. This one, however, was without a doubt worth the time.

Mother and son over the long haul, Faye and Samuel - a great unfolding and refolding of their relationship. Seriously talented storytelling at play here. Samuel, an oddly compelling and sympathetic character, a teacher struggling to get his act together. Faye, a woman somewhat off the wall for decades for good reasons and bad, an agent of cultural change with vexed measure of responsibility. There are a number of dizzying story lines that are shuffled together at a perfect pace with no loss of balance. Totally surprising, Hill masterfully used an online game called World of Elfscape with characters worthy of entire book for themselves. Remarkable! The reader gets to travel back to Norway in the 1940's, very cool, and other locales and time periods. There are many lesser characters all over the place that easily earned their time on the pages. The writing style varies with great success; almost as if there were multiple authors working together to produce this story. The occasional bouts of ranting in the book were fantastic material that took me slightly out of the action for a perfect position to reflect on the ongoing story; to the effect of pulling me in deeper and deeper.

After finishing the story, I feel I was played by Hill; played like some sort instrument capable of everything from Classical to Rock and Roll and anything else that will move your blood or shake you up the way you like - and have you willing to go on tour to wherever there is a call for music.

This book was intelligent, engrossing, and hands-down solid entertainment. A very memorable book. Nathan Hill is a writer to reckon with. I can't wait to get my hands on his next book.`,

    title: "The Master and Margarita",
    content: `Mikhail Bulgakov, who is no stranger to the pale fire of a burning manuscript, has created a masterpiece of fiction that truly cannot be burned. Having been completed, but not fully edited, by the time of Bulgakov’s demise, this novel survived Soviet censorship and the test of time to remain one of the foremost Russian novels of the 20th century, and still holds relevance in today’s world. From political intrigue and scathing social satire to religious commentary and witches on broomsticks, this is one of those rare books that can nestle its way into the deep places of almost any reader’s heart. Bulgakov lovingly loads each page with semi-auto-biographical frustrations and sharp irony as he unleashes the (literal) powers of hell upon Soviet Moscow.

Manuscripts don’t burn…

Inspired by the epic Faust in its various forms, notably the opera which our author frequently attended, Master and Margarita spins the story of a Mephistopheles, Woland, and his cohorts as they wreck havoc upon the Moscow. This allows Bulgakov to deliver a potent slap in the face to all facets of the obdurate Soviet society that oppressed him and his contemporaries. Specifically targeted are those of the arts, particularly the authors of the times who used their words to tow the party line and the literary critics whom Bulgakov detested. The bitter satire of these writers, many of which are thrust into an existential epiphany that they are nothing but pathetic frauds when compared to Russia’s heroes of the pen such as Alexander Pushkin. Mass mockery is made of the numerous beaurocrats and departments, the ease in which a citizen can be arrested, and endless other events that make the daily life of the 20's seem utterly absurd. It is no surprise countless characters find themselves in the asylum, the only place with order, comfort and logic in all of Bulgakov’s depiction of Moscow.

Juxtaposed with Moscow is the tread of Pontius Pilate, which may or may not be the pages of the Master’s book. As the Master is not a far cry from Bulgakov himself, readers may notice a wonderful spiral into metafictional oblivion beginning here, and may begin to question the very notions and fabric of the novel they hold in their hands. Such as, who really is the intrusive narrator who whimsically guides us through this drama of demons, dreams and destiny, and where does the line between fiction and supposed-fact lie? However, I digress, and I return you to the tread of Pontius Pilate. Or, dear reader, shall I digress yet again, and direct your attention to the implicit irony inherent in the novel’s heroes: Woland (your charming Mephistopheles) and Pontius Pilate, the man who signed the death certificate of Jesus. Things are not always what they seem in this novel, and much of the dialogue and events are interestingly ironic. But yet, what is more flagrant to the upheld Soviet atheism than the devil himself preaching that Christ did in fact live? For how can they deny religion when the devil is right in their face? Bulgakov is a funny genius.

And now, finally, I return to the Pilate thread, which itself is teeming with irony. For in the Pilate chapters, the reader will find a story that is seemingly biblical shorn of all religious implications and instead illuminating political plots and an attempt at a historically plausible event (the Master was a historian, or so he says) while the biblical allusions and quotations are found within the Moscow chapters instead. The ‘Satan’s Grand Ball’, of all places, has the most frequent biblical quotes and allusions. In a way, Pilate’s world is not unlike Bulgakov’s Moscow, full of dirty politics and persecution. On the other hand, the modern Moscow, which denies religion is full of religious symbolism (the 12 members seated at the MASSOLIT table, the severed head on a plate, etc).

Each sentence of this book is a joy. The writing simply flows and is incredibly comical, plus the characters are very lovable. Woland’s demonic procession are highly entertaining and the reader will be compelled to keep reading just to see what chaos can be stirred by them as they flood the city. The Master, whom is a hero to all repressed authors, and his lovely Margarita are the gems within this story however. Although they lend their names to this novels title, these two lovers make up a very small portion to the story, and aren’t even relevant until part 2 when the book finds a groove and takes off like a cannon shot after wandering along the streets of Moscow for the first hundred and some odd pages. Always aware of his literary predecessors, Bulgakov leaves constant ‘scholarly jokes’ (as the translators put it) and allusions for a reader with an eye for Russian novels to discover. Anyone who is as enamored with the prose of Nikolai Gogol as I am should definitely read this novel. Gogol is apparently a large hero of Bulgakov’s and he makes several allusions as well as stylistic choices fashioned off this master of absurdity.

There are many different translations of this book, I myself chose the Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O’Connor version published by Vintage (because really, you can’t go wrong with Vintage usually, not always but usually) because it offered a full version of the text and included many very helpful and insightful notes that really helped highlight the social context and the more apocryphal references. Nate has a wonderful review that highlights the differences between the many translations and was very helpful in my choosing of this text. As I cannot read it as intended in it’s original language, I felt this was at least ‘second-grade fresh’.

I cannot stress more how incredible this book is. It is just an all-around good time and a marvelous example of magical-realism used to its highest capacity. Despite it’s often dark and macabre nature, it is uplifting and laugh out loud funny. Plus, the ending is a kick to the head. I read much of this through the subways of Boston recently while on a much-needed and exceptional vacation, and, like Pilate and his crucified friend, the memory of both have become one. Bulgakov’s masterpiece has survived censorship and translation to make it to you, don’t pass it by!`,

    title: "The Buffalo Hunter Hunter",
    content: `Horror hits differently when it’s built on the bones of real, genocidal history. The blood, viscera, and supernatural vampire horror is plentiful in The Buffalo Hunter Hunter but it pales in comparison to the real horror story: the brutality of colonisation, the events of the Marias Massacre, and the hunting of the buffalo to near extinction.

The Buffalo Hunter Hunter dredges up the historical truth of the massacre, reminding us of the ways history is often written by the victors/colonisers, and consequently sanitised, whitewashed or buried. We get the story through three different perspectives: the eyes of a Blackfeet named Good Stab, a Lutheran pastor and a professor seeking tenure at the University of Wyoming.

The book is a reckoning, an excavation of memory and trauma wrapped in the intimacy of Good Stab’s confessional-style recordings. The epistolary format makes it feel almost voyeuristic, like I’ve stumbled onto something not meant for outside eyes.

Initially, the language of Good Stab took time for me to settle into, because it wasn’t diluted for convenience. There’s no glossary, no hand-holding, no neat little footnotes.

Instead, I had to work for my understanding. It’s a deliberate artistic choice by SGJ, and one I respect and revere. My interpretation is that the language is something to be felt, experienced, understood through context and immersion. The effort you put in to adapt to the flow makes the emotional payoff all the richer.

Additionally, The Buffalo Hunter Hunter is not an easy read, nor should it be. Some books exist to comfort, to provide escape. This one exists to confront the carnage that history books so often obscure. The sheer amount of blood, brutality, both against people and animals, is staggering, so be mindful of the content warnings. This book doesn’t just shock, it opens up a wound that never really healed. And that's a history we can’t afford to forget, no matter how ugly it gets.

I’m going to have to add SGJ officially to my favourite list of horror writers. Obviously I recommend this one highly. But that recommendation comes with a warning for a gut-wrenching, painful, but necessary read for understanding the true weight of history.`,

    title: "The Cookbook Club",
    content: `The Cookbook Club by Beth Harbison is a women’s fiction title about three very different women who come together and find they do have things in common. The point of view in the story will of course change the during the course of the book.

The story all starts with Trista Walker who has decided to leave her demanding job at a prestigious law firm and open her own restaurant. Trista wants to do something new, something different, but with so many ways to go she decides she wants to test some and puts out an ad for others to join her and test out recipes, thus the Cookbook Club is created.

Margo Everson decides to answer the ad when she sees it being at a place in her life she needs something new. Margo’s husband had asked for a divorce and left her with a rundown house and a lot of cookbooks so why not take up the club as a hobby? Aja Alexander answers the ad looking for something to take her mind off of her relationship and the fact she has a secret that she isn’t sure what to do about.

The Cookbook Club by Beth Harbison was a book that gained my interest quickly and had me engaged as I wondered what would happen with these three very different characters. As the three ladies came together in the book you learn all about them and different their lives were but in many ways much the same. It was great watching the friendships unfold and the growth of the characters that came in the story as it went on. Of course there is some food talk in the book but it didn’t overpower the character growth or their journeys.

I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.`,

    title: "Strange Bedfellows",
    content: `Good Gawd! Ariel Slamet Ries knows how to make my knees quake. This was absolutely perfect in every single way imaginable. The quickest way to my heart is to have a lovable queer character as the MC. Then bringing in a found family (as well as a really supportive blood relation family) and a story that mixes highs and lows to keep me on my toes, is definitely a recipe for success… for me at least.

In the future, not too far, but far enough that humans live on a different planet, Oberon wakes up to find out he has powers. Normally, you learn around your 9th birthday if you’ve gained “ghost” powers, but he’s in college. He’s spent his whole life thinking he’s the only child of his parents to be “normal.” So this comes at a surprise, but it’s what he’s always wanted. He’s able to manifest his dreams. Kind of like corporeal illusions, Obi can make his dreams come alive until he wills them gone again.

How does he find this all out? His childhood crush, Kon, magically appears one day out of the blue. He’s kind of like a wake up call from his loneliness, as well as a realization that he is special. In a weird, and yet beautiful, effect of all of this, he begins to fall in love with his own dream-crush… which I kind of saw coming. But what I didn’t see coming was for that same dream crush to…….. wait! I don’t want to tell you. 😅It’s a spoiler.

Let me start (not actually, because we’re 4 paragraphs in) by telling you that the art for Strange Bedfellows is BREATHTAKING! The author uses such vivid colors in their work and it kept me entranced like the creepy snake from The Jungle Book. I couldn’t look away! I needed to know how the story ended. HOW COULD THEY MAKE THIS WORK?????

It wasn’t until about half of the book was completed until I realized that the MC is trans. I thought he was beautiful before, but the character got scar tattoos under his pectorals to look like top surgery for “long before” (our time). It was such a beautiful sentiment and I couldn’t feel the joy in it. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!

I need more books like this in my life!!! If I could give it more stars than 5, I would.`,

    title: "Lyneham",
    content: `Finding a planet habitable for humans doesn't seem all that difficult, given the abundance of things in the universe: there are solar systems everywhere, and the assumption that "life" develops in a similar way is a reasonable one, or at least that's what we believe in our limited perspective. Only the time to bridge the gap is the crucial point. That's what you think. At least I do. But is that really the case?

I've read two books by this author so far, and they left very different impressions on me: First, Athos 2643, a science fiction thriller from the perspective of an AI, which I found very unusual and difficult to read, but I really enjoyed it in its uniqueness!
And Core Shadow, a science thriller from 2014, perhaps more from the author's early days as a writer, as neither the characters nor the plot really convinced me.

That's precisely why I was curious to see how I would like his new book, because the blurb sounded extremely promising.

When I first read the prologue, I just thought: Wow! It really blew my mind because Nils Westerboer begins with a small experiment that many of you are surely familiar with, and then shifts to the recurring goal of many people to colonize another planet. The ideas behind this were so coherent and yet completely new to me that I had to let it sink in.

"If you're flying a hundred meters a second and your ship crashes into something, and you're not in your room, you become a painting on the wall."
Quote

The first chapter begins with the arrival on Perm. Henry is 12 when he, his father, and his two siblings want to find a new home on the moon in a distant solar system. Initially, there's not much discussion about why this new planet is supposed to be home—except that the habitability here isn't as high as expected, and above all, there are certain anomalies on the surface that pose a danger; and Henry's father is supposed to help research them.
Henry and the other children quickly learn to adapt to this life, even though they are acutely aware of how unreal it all seems to them.

When our eyes met, I realized that I should never be jealous of him and the light he carried within him. Envy would take me further away from it than I could ever imagine. The only way to receive some of Melcher's light was to love it.
Quote

Between the chapters, there are excerpts from reports—or rather, a description of the exploration of the moon Permian for adaptation to human life. I always found that very interesting because Nils Westerboer comes up with really interesting ideas that sound completely absurd: but that's just how it is. We have absolutely no idea how "life" would develop on other planets with different conditions. What exact prerequisites are necessary, what emerges from them, which creatures with which characteristics, talents, or intelligence would emerge.`,

this book truly was visceral in every sense of the word cause the anger, disgust, frustration and anxiety i experienced while reading it felt like a living thing. Gia is stripped of her humanity and becomes a shell of who she used to be, until she’s broken down to the most basic animalistic parts of herself and turns that inner rage into fuel that will gain her back her own autonomy over her body and her life.. bathed in blood. there were so many scenes in here that really had me speechless, i always love when horror garners strong reactions out of me. i liked the way the author tackled a very real issue that many women face and made it into something so unflinching, all while showing that there’s no lengths that women can’t or won’t go to in order to survive. this was by no means an easy read, but an impactful one. i’ll definitely keep my eye on Mia Ballard’s future releases.

quote from the authors note that really stuck with me:

“Women have always been cast as caretakers, peacekeepers, and forgivers. We’re told to edure, to adapt, to rise above. But sometimes, the only way to heal is to rage. Sometimes, justice isn’t quiet or clean; it’s feral and bloody and unapologetic.”`,

    title: "Stag Dance",
    content: `I love how the four stories really and truly feel like they belong together, each story casting new light on the stories before and after, even though they’re all so different. I love how fucked up and real and ridiculous these stories are—all four of them—how lovely, romantic, perverse, generous, absurd. I love how it starts in the future and ends in a swiftly-receding present, but spends most of its time snowbound at an illegal logging camp, in an ambiguous, near mythic past. It made me want to read lumberjack novels all winter. It made me want to write a lumberjack novel of my own. It made me want to pin a brown triangle to my pants and show up to work drunk and wander out the back door into the woods with a blinking lantern and chop wood in a pioneer dress and dance.

I’ve been listening—like the rest of the world, I take it—to “Good Luck, Babe!” You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling. I’m the kind of queer person who is either blindingly visible or comfortably invisible. My choice. How simple, for me, to navigate the world as who I’m not. But navigate the world as who you’re not—is that not then a considerable part of who you are? Selves multiply indiscriminately. Logic demands that we cannot be what we aren’t. Is the illusion of falseness just another bitter artifact of capitalist self-fashioning? Or am I asking the wrong questions? Generally, temperamentally, I have little desire to draw attention to myself. But you’d have to stop the world… Spend too much time vanishing and your whole life starts to go gray around the edges. Or put it plainly, why not? Spend too much time as a man... something I am and am not, like Schrödinger's cat (look in the box—it’s a gender reveal party!)

Our bodies, our desires. These soft fleshy vessels—I’m tempted to say that we inhabit them, but that is just Christianity speaking through me, no? A soul—divine spark in flawed earthly vessel. Even as we muster our forces for a full frontal attack on binary gender, this other binary is in our sights: soul and body, mind and flesh, spirit and dust. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. I call bullshit.

None of it makes sense, because we don’t choose anything and somehow we choose everything. Because our bodies and our desires aren’t ours, not really—they’re something we do with other people, something we make and something we’re given and a series of stupid frustrating questions without answers that only make sense on Tuesday mornings and Friday nights and crack up into our own homegrown youtube oblivion the moment we try—fools that we are—to consider them dispassionately.

And so what choice do we have? We turn to stories. These four are some of the best.`,

    title: "Blood Beneath the Snow",
    content: `Blood Beneath the Snow was unfortunately a letdown for me. Sigh. I really loved the idea of a wintery tournament where siblings fight to death to win a crown. What I got instead was 200 pages of training sequences and a main character who constantly needed to remind everyone of how terrible but also how special she was at the same time. *Pulls hair out*

Not to mention a love interest 'dark and dangerous mystery man' is called The HellBringer? 🤡 No. I cannot take that seriously. I kept thinking about a mid-aged biker. The Hellbringer lol.

The story opens with a bunch of side characters the main character interacts with. And then the side characters basically cease to be in the narrative, even though the main character claims that everything she does, she does for them. The side characters felt underdeveloped and indistinguishable.

The pacing was horrid in this. I was actually enjoying the first little bit of the story. I'd say until about 25% lol sounds sad because it's so early on, but the beginning was very action packed, with our FMC running through the city to escape capture. But we're quickly drawn to a halt and slammed with lengthy dialogue chapters with nothing actually really happening.

For me, this put a huge damper in things... There's not much worse than dreading picking up a book and/or skimming over chapters and constantly looking at the minute count left. That's where most books go to die for me.

It's like, we started with all of these characters and to me, what felt like a vast world and the author whittled all of that away and left us with the annoying FMC stuck in a cave - and we're just left to our on imagination as to what is going on in the world on the outside of this cave. The friends, the people, the whole ass war.

I typically prefer third person to first person because I don't like being trapped in the main character's head. This is first person and not only are we trapped in the FMC's mind, but the author completely shuts the reader out of what is going on aside from this boring mundane 'training' between this supposed pair. It was like hitting a brick wall. Day after day I'd struggle to get through these chapters.... They're long and there's many of them. Such a huge chuck of boring plotline.

Speaking of the romance - or lack thereof. These two felt really forced to me. I didn't feel the chemistry; they barely communicate with each other. It's all kind of all tell no show type of scenario. Because the author said so and so it is ✨. Ugh. No.

I also thought the Hellbringer's character was poorly constructed. To avoid potential spoilers, I won't go into specifics, but it just didn't feel authentic or likely. He's like the Temu version of Rhys.

To me, this felt like a poor attempt at a mash up of many popular romantasies. If these tropes are your jam though, give it a try - hope that it works better for you. If you're looking for something well written, original and thoroughly entertaining - might give it a pass.`,

    title: "Promise Me Sunshine",
    content: `Oh how sweet was this book! (at least the second half)

First impressions weren’t great, I honestly didn’t love either character & couldn’t fathom a romance occurring. But then it made sense…Lenny’s in no shape for anything romantic and needs an anchor of some sort (in comes Miles). He’s been through first-hand what Lenny’s currently feeling & the way he guides/helps her I ended up loving! Their relationship was so slow burn, but seeing them connect in a very personal way I really enjoyed. Miles ended up being so thoughtful & caring & maybe (definitely) grumpy, but the development was there! Lenny was so awkward & cringy lol - but getting to know her and her personality, I had to just let her do her

I also absolutely loved the way the author handled grief, knowing it’s never gonna leave you but it can get easier some days & how a companion to relate to and lean on may help the pain. I also love the way the author describes feelings & moments! So much showing rather than telling and it was wonderful ⭐️

“Lenny, when I look at your face, I feel like I’m finally home after a really long day at work”

“Grief is a relationship,” he continues. “It’s the way we figure out how to keep loving them even though they’re gone. And in order to do that we have to keep on going. And going and going.”

“He treats you well?” “Mom, he walked into hell and dragged me back out.”`,

    title: "Good Soil",
    content: `This is one of those rare, precious books that filled my soul with a glimpse of how, on this muddy planet full of wrongdoing and death, God or love or grace might still be near to us. But it is a grace tinged with sadness, a love marked by loss, a faith that hopes rather than one that knows. I’ve already recommended GOOD SOIL to more people in real life than any book in recent memory. It has me whispering to my discouraged friends, my queer friends, my one-foot-out-the-door friends, Jesus-loving-but-anti-Christian-nationalism friends, “Have you heard of Jeff Chu?”

The book is grounded in reflections arising out of Chu’s time working and taking classes at the Farminary (the farm at Princeton Theological Seminary), but as Chu counsels in the Author’s Note, he employs a circular rather than a linear mode of storytelling. The writing is exceptional, so it’s never hard to follow; even when the narratives seem fragmented, there’s always a purpose. He pulls in stories of his ancestor’s journeys, his parents’ disapproval of his sexuality, the food and language of his Cantonese American upbringing, his questions about faith and God, and the lessons of compost and little deaths and perpetual grief. Despite the specificity of Chu’s story, this book speaks universally to the human condition; I’m convinced that Chu is the sage that our times require. He does the radical (and highly unpopular) thing of loving one’s enemies with gentle strength and courage, but without compromising his spiritual integrity. And it all comes back to his confidence in God’s boundless love.

A remarkable book that will both heal and challenge you.`,

    title: "Source Code: My Beginnings",
    content: `In his deeply personal memoir "Source Code: My Beginnings," Bill Gates takes readers on an intimate journey through his early years, offering unprecedented insight into the experiences, relationships, and circumstances that shaped one of the most transformative figures in modern history. Unlike his previous books that focused on technology and philanthropy ("The Road Ahead," "Business @ the Speed of Thought," "How to Avoid a Climate Disaster," and "How to Prevent the Next Pandemic"), this memoir delves into the human story behind the tech titan.

The Making of a Tech Pioneer

Family Foundations

Gates masterfully weaves together the influences of his upstanding and ambitious parents - Bill Sr., a respected Seattle attorney, and Mary, a civic leader who broke glass ceilings in banking and philanthropy. The portrait he paints of his grandmother "Gami" is particularly touching, showing how her mathematical mind and principled nature helped shape his own intellectual development through countless card games and life lessons.

Early Signs of an Exceptional Mind

The memoir excels at illustrating Gates's unique cognitive makeup from an early age. His intense focus, ability to process vast amounts of information, and tendency to rock while thinking deeply - traits that might today be associated with neurodivergence - are portrayed with refreshing candor. Gates acknowledges both the challenges and advantages of his distinctive mental wiring, offering valuable perspective on neurodiversity in leadership.

Strengths and Notable Elements

Rich Historical Context

The book expertly situates Gates's personal story within the broader technological revolution of the 1960s and '70s. His descriptions of early computing environments, from the PDP-10 mainframe to the groundbreaking Altair 8800, provide fascinating historical context for today's digital world.

Complex Relationships

Gates doesn't shy away from exploring complicated dynamics, particularly with his mother Mary, whose high expectations both drove and challenged him. The friendship with Paul Allen is portrayed with nuance, acknowledging both their creative synergy and occasional tensions.

Technical Detail with Human Interest

While the book contains plenty of technical detail about early programming and computer architecture, Gates maintains accessibility by grounding these elements in human stories and relatable analogies.`,
